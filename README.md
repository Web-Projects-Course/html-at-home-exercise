# HTML at-home exercise

Now that you marked up an existing text file as HTML, lets create our own HTML document. This one will serve as a brief introduction to the class.

The file *index.html* has already been created for you. You can simply add your content to the existing HTML. The document includes a number of elements that structure the page. Read the comments to get a sense of what they do, but will spend some time on this next class. 

### Things to include
* **Heading:** Your name
* **Introduction:** a paragraph introducing yourself (background, major, etc.)
* **Goals:** An ordered list of at least 3 things you would like to accomplish this semester.
* **Links:** A bulleted list  of links to three websites/projects you find beautiful, inspiring, or dreadful.
