# HTML at-home exercise

Lets create our own HTML document. This one will serve as a brief introduction to the class.

The file *index.html* has already been created for you. You can simply add your content to the existing HTML. The document includes a number of elements that structure the page. Read the comments to get a sense of what they do, but will spend some time on this next class.

This exercise will serve two purposes. One, it will give you some practice with the basic HTML elements. Two, it will give me (and you) a clearer picture of what you want to accomplish this semester.

To do this we are going to pretend that you are writing this on May 16, just after our final critique of the semester. 

You have completed your final project and your very proud of it. You have also learned a some new skills this semester and been introduced to some new ideas. Take some time describing in detail what your project is, why it was sucessful, what new skills you learned and some subjects/ideas you have learned more about.

### Things to include
* **Primary heading:** Your name
* **Introduction paragraph:** a paragraph introducing yourself (background, major, etc.)
* **Secondary heading:** Your project title
* **Paragraph** Describe what your final project is, how it works, what it looks like.
* **Secondary heading** What I learned.
* **Paragraph** Describe what new skills you learned this semester. What topics did you learn more about?
* **Links:** A bulleted list  of links to three websites/projects you find beautiful, inspiring, or dreadful.

This project is an exercise to get you to think a head a little. I won't hold you to accomplishing this particular project at the end of the semester, but try and make it something that you think you might like to do. Again detail is important however. Is it a multipage site? Does it have lots of images? How many what are they like?
